# Survival-Analysis
# Express Clothing CoMarketing Analysis

# About Data
Express Clothing Co is currently positioned as a fashion forward clothing brand for young professionals. Whether heading to the board room or for a night on the town Express provides cloths that will make the customer look and feel their best. 

# Analysis
Goal of the analysis was to predict life-time value of a customer. As customers don't behave similarly, we tried to find different segments of customer within the data. We performed "elasticity modelling" for each segments to find the segment of people which are indifferent to price increase. We also did survival analysis to see which parameter can be highly effective to reduce the number days for next purchase.

# Proposal
Based on our models we have developed a plan which we expect to drive 0.5% additional revenue, roughly $50 million, and 10% direct marketing cost savings over the course of the next year.
